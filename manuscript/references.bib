abstract = {When human interventions interfere with the natural regulation of wildlife populations by favouring some species, overabundance can emerge. We evaluated different methods of estimating red deer abundance in a wide range of population densities from southern Spain. Distance sampling estimates were used as the reference method across 22 localities and were compared with two kilometric abundance indices (KAIs), four indices based on pellet group counts and two browsing indices (BWIs). The average red deer density estimated by distance sampling was 19.51 +/- 3.19 deer per 100 ha, showing a wide range across the study area (0.04-66.77). Distance sampling estimates correlated with the KAIs, pellet group-based index and the BWI. The agreement with distance sampling improved when groups were used instead of individuals in the KAIs, when the minimum pellet group size was fixed at 20 pellets in the dropping counts, and when only highly palatable species were used in the BWI. Thus, several direct and indirect methods can estimate red deer abundance in Mediterranean habitats from Southern Spain with appropriate modifications.},

abstract = {Understanding how large herbivores shape plant diversity patterns is an important challenge in community ecology, especially because many ungulate populations in the northern hemisphere have recently expanded. Because species within plant communities can exhibit strong interactions (e.g., competition, facilitation), selective foraging by large herbivores is likely not only to affect the abundance of palatable species, but also to induce cascading effects across entire plant communities. To investigate these possibilities, we first tested the effects of deer browsing and soil disturbance on herbaceous plant diversity patterns in boreal forest, using standard analyses of variance. Second, we evaluated direct and indirect effects of deer browsing and soil disturbance on the small-scale richness of herbaceous taxa using a multilevel path analysis approach. The first set of analyses showed that deer browsing and soil disturbance influenced herb richness. Path analyses revealed that deer browsing and soil disturbance influenced richness via complex chains of interactions, involving dominant (i.e., the most abundant) browsing-tolerant (DBT) taxa and white birch (Betula papyrifera), a species highly preferred by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found no evidence that an increase of white birch in fenced quadrats was the direct cause of a decrease in herb richness. However, we found strong evidence that a higher abundance of DBT taxa (i.e., graminoids and Circium arvense), both in fenced and unfenced quadrats, increased herb layer richness. We propose an empirical model in which competitive interactions between white birch and DBT taxa regulate the strength of facilitative relationships between the abundance of DBT taxa and herb richness. In this model, deer browsing and the intensity of soil disturbance initiate a complex chain of cascading effects in boreal plant communities by controlling the abundance of white birch.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that the increase of wild ungulates worldwide is responsible of strong deleterious impacts on various component of forest biodiversity (tree and shrub regeneration, insects, songbirds). Plant communities are particularly affected by overbrowsing, and overabundant deer are increasingly recognized as a major factor of decline in understory plant diversity in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems.In grassland ecosystems, refuges from herbivores have been shown to provide suitable habitat for plants sensitive to browsing and grazing, and to allow the conservation of rare plant species. In the present study we analyze if such refuges can maintain representative samples of forest plant communities exposed to strong browsing pressure by deer. For this we used the unique situation offered by the presence, side by side, on the Haida Gwaii archipelago of forested islands colonized or not by introduced deer.We compared plant assemblages on rocky outcrop to assemblages found in the adjacent field-layer in order (1) to assess, on islands without deer, the potential of refuges to be representative of the local field-layer communities and (2), on islands colonized by deer for over 60. years, to analyze how far plant assemblages on rocky outcrops are representative of un-browsed field-layer communities and can serve as bioassays for field-layer plant communities in the absence of unbrowsed reference sites. We did this for forest-interior field-layer plant communities as well as for the forest edge plant communities found along the shorelines. We used refuges on treefall mounds to assess the role refuges can play as sources of propagules in two understory shrubs and ferns.Our results indicate that, in presence of deer, plant species density and plant cover are dramatically higher in refuges than in the adjacent field-layer plots. The comparison of these refuge communities to the reference state provided by the field-layer on islands without deer indicated that refuges maintain a representative part of the unbrowsed plant community, although with differences in the cover percentage in some plants. Some typical plants are more abundant in the refuges and, more sobering, six field-layer species are only poorly present in the rocky habitat. Despite these differences and their small size, refuges shelter a representative part of the understory and forest edge vegetation of the studied sites and could serve as a bioassay of deer overbrowsing in situations lacking a reference state. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We examined the response of understory plants in mature maple-dominated forests of southern Qu??bec, Canada, following about 30 years of high deer densities, using a deer exclosure experiment. An exclosure and a paired control of 625m2 each were established on six sites in 1998. An exclosure and a paired control of 16m2 were added at each of the same sites in 2003 but under a recent canopy gap to determine if light could enhance plant responses. We measured plant richness and abundance, and aboveground biomass of different plant groups for 8 years in the understory plots and for 3 years in the canopy gaps. Four herbaceous species were also monitored individually in the same plots. No significant differences between treatments were found in plots under forest cover, except for lateral obstruction at 0-50cm height which was higher in the exclosures. Under canopy gaps, however, tree seedling and total plant abundance were higher in deer exclosures than in control plots. Trillium erectum recovered partially as individuals were taller, had larger leaves and more frequently produced a flower or a fruit in the absence of deer browsing under forest cover. To a lesser extent, Erythronium americanum and Maianthemum canadense also exhibited signs of recovery but were still at the single-leaf stage after 8 years of recovery. In general, the different plant groups exhibited little recovery following deer exclusion, possibly because of the low light levels that prevailed in the understory of undisturbed maple-dominated forests. The higher latitude of the present study could also contribute to the slow recovery rates of the different groups of plants compared to studies conducted in northeastern USA. Variability among sites and years had an effect on detection of statistically significant differences. Trends are however appearing over time, suggesting that many understory plants are recovering very slowly following deer exclusion. Our results emphasize the importance of studying large herbivore-forest interactions on different groups of plants, but also on specific species, and under different latitudes to be fully understood. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Soil seed bank composition is important to the recovery of natural and semi-natural areas from disturbance and serves as a safeguard against environmental catastrophe. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations have increased dramatically in eastern North America over the past century and can have strong impacts on aboveground vegetation, but their impacts on seed bank dynamics are less known. To document the long-term effects of deer browsing on plant successional dynamics, we studied the impacts of deer on both aboveground vegetation and seed bank composition in plant communities following agricultural abandonment. In 2005, we established six 15 × 15 m fenced enclosures and paired open plots in recently followed agricultural fields near Ithaca, NY, USA. In late October of each of six years (2005-2010), we collected soil from each plot and conducted seed germination cycles in a greenhouse to document seed bank composition. These data were compared to measurements of aboveground plant cover (2005-2008) and tree density (2005-2012). The impacts of deer browsing on aboveground vegetation were severe and immediate, resulting in significantly more bare soil, reduced plant biomass, reduced recruitment of woody species, and relatively fewer native species. These impacts persisted throughout the experiment. The impacts of browsing were even stronger on seed bank dynamics. Browsing resulted in significantly decreased overall species richness (but higher diversity), reduced seed bank abundance, relatively more short-lived species (annuals and biennials), and fewer native species. Both seed bank richness and the relative abundance of annuals/biennials were mirrored in the aboveground vegetation. Thus, deer browsing has long-term and potentially reinforcing impacts on secondary succession, slowing succession by selectively consuming native perennials and woody species and favoring the persistence of short-lived, introduced species that continually recruit from an altered seed bank.},

abstract = {Montados are agro-silvo-pastoral ecosystems, typical of the Southwest Iberian Peninsula, of high socio-economic and conservation importance, where grazing is a dominant activity. Montados are characterized by an open tree canopy of Quercus sp. and a diverse undercover of shrubs and grasslands that constitute the plant food resources for grazing animals. Plant food resources of Montados are highly variable, both spatially and seasonally, in quantity and quality.

abstract = {The fact that herbivores and predators exert top-down effects to alter community composition and dynamics at lower trophic levels is no longer controversial, yet we still lack evidence of the full nature, extent, and longer-term effects of these impacts. Here, we use results from a set of replicated experiments on the local impacts of white-tailed deer to evaluate the extent to which such impacts could account for half-century shifts in forest plant communities across the upper Midwest, USA. We measured species' responses to deer at four sites using 10-20 year-old deer exclosures. Among common species, eight were more abundant outside the exclosures, seven were commoner inside, and 16 had similar abundances in- and outside. Deer herbivory greatly increased the abundance of ferns and graminoids and doubled the abundance of exotic plants. In contrast, deer greatly reduced tree regeneration, shrub cover (100-200 fold in two species), plant height, plant reproduction, and the abundance of forbs. None of 36 focal species increased in reproduction or grew taller in the presence of deer, contrary to expectations. We compared these results to data on 50-year regional shifts in species abundances across 62 sites. The effects of herbivory by white-tailed deer accurately account for many of the long-term regional shifts observed in species' abundances (R2 = 0.41). These results support the conjecture that deer impacts have driven many of the regional shifts in forest understory cover and composition observed in recent decades. Our ability to link results from shorter-term, local experiments to regional long-term studies of ecological change strengthens the inferences we can draw from both approaches.},

abstract = {Herbivory is one of the most important biotic disturbance types globally and is important for community structure and composition through species filtering. In northern forest ecosystems the population densities of wild-ranging ungulates, which are managed through hunting, have reached historically high numbers. Conservation concerns frequently arise, both in media and scientific literature. One key question is whether increased deer densities negatively affect biodiversity and whether management should implement reduction in deer densities. Few studies have addressed wild herbivores-plant richness relationships using a full length gradient of herbivory. Such gradient approach where herbivory is studied from very low to very high intensity, may enable us to develop operational management guidelines for deer densities We recorded the ungulate herbivory intensities on the island Svan{\o}y in west Norway across 10. years and related this to the present plant richness of an old-growth pine-forest system, recording all plant species groups of the forest understory. The herbivory intensity-plant richness relationship followed a unimodally peaked curved, but plant richness was lower only at forest sites with artificially high red deer herbivory. Overall, the herbivory-richness relationships of functional groups fitted expectations in that the richness of low-growing functional groups as forbs, graminoids and mosses all increased within natural levels of herbivory intensities, whereas the richness of the taller growing woody species of the forest understory, dwarf-shrubs and young trees, decreased along the intensity gradient. We validated the gradient approach by experimental exclosure data. Management for relatively high deer densities may benefit the overall understory plant richness of such forest ecosystems at the expense of richness of woody plants. We suggest that the herbivory-induced reduction of the understory woody layer is the key to understand the overall increase in plant species richness. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Deleterious effects of overabundant deer populations within natural areas have been well documented and hunting programs have been initiated to control populations and facilitate the recovery of vegetation communities. However, few studies have examined whether recovery has occurred following sustained hunting. Hunting was initiated during the 1990s to reduce overabundant deer populations in Indiana state parks. In 2010, we resampled 108 plots established in 1996/97 across 15 state parks and five historically-hunted reference areas to quantify changes in herbaceous-layer vegetation. Species cover was measured along three, 10. m line transects nested within each plot. Data were pooled for all parks and reference areas. We calculated species richness (S), evenness (E), and Shannon-Weiner diversity (H') in 1996/97 and 2010. Compositional changes between sample intervals and contemporary composition across environmental gradients were examined using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS). We observed greater increases in herbaceous-layer cover in parks than in reference areas. S and H' increased significantly in parks, but not reference areas. NMS ordinations revealed unidirectional changes in species composition between parks and their respective reference areas with the composition of parks becoming more similar to that of reference areas through time. Park size, cumulative deer harvest, initial deer abundance, and recent average of harvest/hunter effort were significantly correlated (p{\textless}. 0.05) with ordination scores in four out of five natural regions (|. r|. {\textgreater}. 0.5 for at least one axis). Browse-sensitive functional groups increased in cover while that of exotic species decreased. Changes were most pronounced for tree seedlings, which displayed a sixfold increase in cover within parks between sample intervals. These results suggest that hunting has allowed recovery of degraded vegetation communities. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Large ungulate populations are associated with the degradation of many forest plant communities, but it is unclear if these population sizes are strictly a contemporary phenomenon. Human exploitation models predict they are not, with ungulate numbers varying with long-term fluctuations in hunting pressure. Alternatively, human disturbance models predict that abiotic limitations normally restrict herbivores, with contemporary increases reflecting increased productivity associated with agriculture and forestry. Both can explain ungulate abundance, but may have different implications for plant conservation because they predict different levels of prior evolutionary exposure to herbivory. Here, I review historical records and stand structure studies from degraded oak savanna of western North America to examine whether current ungulate levels are strictly a contemporary phenomenon. Although it was impossible to quantify pre-European herd sizes, all evidence indicates a strong relationship between hunting pressure and ungulate abundance. Historical accounts repeatedly describe large herds of deer and elk at first European contact, followed by sharp declines immediately after colonization, and then rapid recovery beginning in the early 1900s as subsistence hunting waned. Stand structure data for oak woodland appear to support this model. Present-day oak woodlands mostly derive from mass recruitment from 1850 to 1910, coinciding with the near elimination of ungulates by hunting. Although these results suggest that large ungulate herds are not strictly a contemporary phenomenon, browsing intensity appears to be unprecedented given limited hunting, predator extirpation, and savanna fragmentation within productive pasture and early successional forest. Hunting pressure thus continues to be important, in that it is now largely absent. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Summary: Grazing mammals are often used to maintain and restore high conservation value plant communities, but the evidence base for management is lacking long-term studies. We erected grazing exclosures in dune slacks to determine the impact of three different grazing regimes on the plant community: (1) rabbits and sheep excluded for 36 years, (2) continued rabbit grazing for 36 years and (3) rabbit grazing for 17 years followed by rabbit and sheep grazing for 19 years. We monitored plant community composition inside and outside the exclosures. All of the plant communities changed over time, moving away from the original high-value system and losing some characteristic species. Grazing slowed succession, reduced woody perennial cover and increased graminoid and forb cover and species diversity. The impact of adding sheep grazing to the existing rabbit grazing was additive at the functional group scale, but both complementary and additive (depending on the species) at the plant species scale. Synthesis and applications. At the levels of grazing present in this study (2{\textperiodcentered}5 sheep ha-1 year-1), sheep had similar impacts on dune slack plant communities to rabbits, making them suitable for replacing or augmenting rabbit grazing for conservation management. At the intensity present in this study, long-term grazing can help to maintain a species-rich dune slack community but is not sufficient for successful restoration. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Semi-natural woodlands are a globally important relict ecosystem for biodiversity, which are threatened through a range of anthropogenically induced changes, including overgrazing by large herbivores. Fencing to conserve biodiversity is increasingly used as a management tool, so the long-term impacts of large herbivore removal requires investigation. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of large herbivore exclusion on vegetation, through time, using empirical long-term vegetation data collected over {\~{}}40. years. The responses of ground flora communities to this removal will be assessed, and it is predicted that a change in woodland vegetation will occur through time. Plant community composition was surveyed in a network of 7 large-herbivore exclosures, within protected temperate oak woodland in Ireland, at intervals up to 41. years. Ground flora species abundance was quantified and time since fencing was used to standardise the survey data, with three time groups being derived from this to assess beta diversity changes through time. With total removal of large herbivores from the oak woodland ecosystem, this study has identified significant changes in ground flora composition and abundance, and a general homogenisation of the vegetation community with increasing time since large herbivore removal. Large-scale long-term fencing of oak woodlands should be replaced by large herbivore management programmes, in order to ensure the conservation of diverse woodland ecosystems. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. Ungulate browsers, when at high densities, are major drivers of vegetation change in forests world-wide. Their effects operate via a variety of generalizable mechanisms related to plant palatability and relative growth rate with respect to browsing pressure. 2. Though such impacts are obviously long-lasting when they determine composition of tree regeneration, we document in a unique long-term (30 year) experiment that biological legacies of initial deer density persist in the understorey herbaceous vegetation at least 20 years after deer densities were equalized. 3. We sampled understorey vegetation in former clear-cut areas where density of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was manipulated (3.9–31.2 deer km2) for 10 years (1979–1990), and stands experienced ambient deer density (ca. 10–12 deer km2) for the next 20 years (1990–2010) to determine whether initial deer density treatments still influenced understorey vegetation in 30-year-old, closed-canopy forests. 4. Stands initially (1979–1990) exposed to higher deer densities had ca. five times higher fern cover and three times the seedling and forb cover in 2010, as well as significantly lower angiosperm species density, compared to stands initially exposed to lower deer densities. 5. These results appear driven by deer avoidance of ferns, allowing them to expand at high deer density and sequester sites for decades. 6. Synthesis. Our long-term, experimental results show unequivocally that elevated deer densities cause significant, profound legacy effects on understorey vegetation persisting at least 20 years. Of relevance regionally and globally where high deer densities have created depauperate understoreys, we expect that deer density reduction alone does not guarantee understorey recovery; stands may need to be managed by removing recalcitrant understorey layers (e.g. ferns).},

abstract = {Changes in climate and in browsing pressure are expected to alter the abundance of tundra shrubs thereby influencing the composition and species richness of plant communities. We investigated the associations between browsing, tundra shrub canopies and their understory vegetation by utilizing a long-term (10-13 seasons) experiment controlling reindeer and ptarmigan herbivory in the subarctic forest tundra ecotone in northwestern Fennoscandia. In this area, there has also been a consistent increase in the yearly thermal sum and precipitation during the study period. The cover of shrubs increased 2.8-7.8 fold in exclosures and these contrasted with browsed control areas creating a sharp gradient of canopy cover of tundra shrubs across a variety of vegetation types. Browsing exclusions caused significant shifts in more productive vegetation types, whereas little or no shift occurred in low-productive tundra communities. The increased deciduous shrub cover was associated with significant losses of understory plant species and shifts in functional composition, the latter being clearest in the most productive plant community types. The total cover of understory vegetation decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of litter showed the opposite response. The cover of cryptogams decreased along with increasing shrub cover, while the cover of forbs was favoured by a shrub cover. Increasing shrub cover decreased species richness of understory vegetation, which was mainly due to the decrease in the cryptogam species. The effects were consistent across different types of forest tundra vegetation indicating that shrub increase may have broad impacts on arctic vegetation diversity. Deciduous shrub cover is strongly regulated by reindeer browsing pressure and altered browsing pressure may result in a profound shrub expansion over the next one or two decades. Results suggest that the impact of an increase in shrubs on tundra plant richness is strong and browsing pressure effectively counteracts the effects of climate warming-driven shrub expansion and hence maintains species richness. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

abstract = {Herbivorous ungulates are key species in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and their recent demographic and geographic expansion in some temperate regions is likely to influence ecological processes, particularly if we consider plants and the frequency of mobile links among plant populations. In forests, long-distance seed dispersal essentially relies on animal movements. Owing to their ability to cover daily long distances, large herbivorous ungulates are assumed to be important vectors for long-distance seed dispersal (hundreds to thousands of metres). To quantify patterns of seed dispersal, we analysed the paths of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) which had been equipped with GPS collars. We used seed gut passage times from a recent companion paper (Picard et al., Ecology and Evolution, 2015;5:2621-2632). We combined the animal movements and seed gut passage times to estimate seed dispersal curves for herbivorous ungulates. On average, the forest ungulates might disperse consumed seeds over distances greater than 2. km, during a 48-h path in the forest. Maximal dispersal distance was longer for red deer (3.5. km) and wild boar (3.2. km) than for roe deer (2.0. km). By combining high excretion rates and long dispersal distance, wild boar appears to be potentially an efficient seed disperser. Seed dispersal by common herbivorous ungulates is likely to play a crucial role in the today's context of rapid environmental changes such as global warming and landscape fragmentation. Differences in the distribution of seed gut passage times and seasonal distances covered underline the relevance of cross comparative approaches and the complementarity of herbivorous ungulates in long-distance seed dispersal.

abstract = {Land-use change and current game management have favored an increasing population of wild ungulates (especially deer) in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we assess the impact of high deer densities ({\textgreater}30 ind km-2) on the highly diverse woody vegetation of Mediterranean ecosystems, where big game have been favored for the last decades. We examine whether prolonged deer browsing (over 30 years) affected plant composition, diversity and dynamics of the original (non-browsed) vegetation. Deer browsing led to an average decrease of 30.4 {\%} in woody plant diversity (species richness), due to a lack of regeneration for the most preferred plant species. Species belonging to early stages of succession (mostly Labiatae and Cistaceae) were non-preferred by deer. Conversely, the most preferred species belonged mainly to late stages of plant succession. Deer impact on Mediterranean shrublands is causing biotic homogenization of plant communities and is threatening vegetation dynamics by forcing it to return to earlier succession stages. Strict deer population control favouring larger trophies but lower offspring numbers together with an adequate habitat management (increasing grass and acorn availability) would be the most efficient measures to reverse this diversity loss. Restoration work seems only appropriate for the most vulnerable species. We highlight the need of sampling deer-free areas with low or null historical browsing to assess the real impact of deer on woody plant diversity and vegetation dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Wild ungulate populations have increased dramatically in the last decades, limiting tree regeneration. However, how different types of shrubs (chemically vs. physically-defended) act as seedlings facilitators under different types of ungulate damage (browsing or rooting) remains largely unknown. Here, we integrate both biotic and abiotic stress to assess seedling survival in three microsites [open, under chemically-defended (aromatic) shrubs and under physically-defended (spiny) shrubs]. We studied seedling survival of a Mediterranean oak ( Quercus pyrenaica) for two contrasting levels of abiotic stress (dry vs. wet growing seasons) in environments where deer (Cervidae) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa) are abundant. After the first summer 24.7{\%} of seedlings were still alive in a wet year whereas only 9.0{\%} seedlings survived in a dry year. Seedling survival was higher under shrub cover, independently of the annual weather conditions and the shrub type. Shrubs, on average, reduced seedling mortality by ungulates approximately 75{\%} in a wet year and only 50{\%} in a dry year due to the greater and earlier impact of browsers (deer) in drier years, when preferred food (green grass) is scarce. Physically-defended shrubs prevent wild boar damage better than other microsites, reducing 35-59{\%} boar damage in comparison to other types of shrubs and 70-77{\%} in comparison to open microsites and, therefore, serve as good nurse shrubs in environments where wild boar are abundant. Physically-defended shrubs also worked well as defense against browsers at low abiotic stress (wet years) but diminished its efficiency in comparison to chemically-defended shrubs at high abiotic stress due to the greater browsing activity of deer on spiny shrubs in dry years. Thus, we recommend the use of chemically-defended shrubs as seedling protectors against browsers. Restoration efforts (e.g. reforestation) under high level of ungulates should take into account the type of ungulate damage (browsing vs. rooting) and the predominant type of shrub mechanism against herbivores (chemical vs. physical) to use shrub cover more efficiently in future restoration practices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overbrowsing has altered plant species diversity throughout deciduous forest understories in eastern North America. Here we report on a landscape-level (306km2) project in Pennsylvania, USA that tracked the herbaceous community response to deer herd reductions. From 2001 to 2007, we estimated deer densities, browse impact on woody seedlings, and censused the herbaceous flora in permanent plots throughout the area. We assessed herb layer species richness, abundance, and dominance and measured three known phytoindicators of deer impact: Trillium spp., Maianthemum canadense, and Medeola virginiana. We predicted that browse-sensitive taxa would increase in abundance, size, and flowering as would overall species diversity following deer culls and browse impact that declined by an order of magnitude by 2007. Following intensified deer harvests, we observed a limited recovery of the herbaceous community. Trillium spp. abundance, height, and flowering; M. canadense cover; and M. virginiana height all increased following herd reductions. Similarly, forb and shrub cover increased by 130{\%} and 300{\%}, respectively. Nevertheless, species diversity (i.e., richness and dominance) did not vary. Our work demonstrates that reducing deer densities can provide rapid morphological and population-level benefits to palatable species without a concomitant recovery in diversity. We suggest that decreasing deer populations alone may not promote plant diversity in overbrowsed, depauperate forests without additional restoration strategies to mitigate a browse-legacy layer dominated by browse-resistant species. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Increased ungulate browsing has altered the composition of plant communities and food webs of forest ecosystems in many regions around the world. To evaluate the cascading impact of deer browsing on pollination and plant reproduction is critical to understand the roles of species interactions in maintaining plant populations and for conservation management. In this study, we investigated the relationships among floral resources of understory herbaceous plants, pollinator visitation, and fruit set of shrub species based on data accumulation over three years in six temperate deciduous forests with deer and without deer. We found that in deer browsed sites, the visitation rate of bumblebees had decreased due to severe reduction in the coverage of autumn-flowering herbaceous plants, while the effect varied between bumblebee species. On the other hand, other insect taxa showed no dependence on variation in autumn floral resources. The two genera of bumblebee-pollinated shrubs showed reduced fruit set due to severe decline in autumn-flowering herbaceous plants and bumblebee visitation (Weigela: {\`{A}}18.5{\%} and Rhododendron: {\`{A}}21.9{\%}). In contrast, the fruit set of shrubs pollinated by insects that did not show dependence on autumn floral resources were not negatively affected by deer browsing. Our results suggest that deer browsing have not only caused negative effects on herbaceous plants, but in addition have negative indirect effects on reproduction of woody plants through cascading effects of pollination linkages.},

This study compares the postfire development of a shrub community with and without deer, after a wildfire occurred in 2003 in a protected area in Central Portugal. We monitored 12 fenced and 12 unfenced plots 2, 3, 4, and 8 years after fire. Within each plot, we established a linear transect and measured the monospecific canopy projections (plant patches). Five plant community indicators (patch number, average patch length, average patch height, patch cover, and patch phytovolume per square meter) were obtained. The diameter and height of individuals of the most abundant shrub species (Cistus salvifolius, Erica scoparia, Myrtus communis, Pistacia lentiscus, Rubus ulmifolius, and Ulex jussiaei) were also measured. These measurements were used as response variables in generalized linear mixed models in order to assess the effects of time-after-fire and fencing, on the development of the plant community. Patch height and phytovolume had a significantly higher growth in fenced plots. At the species level, C. salvifolius, M. communis, R. ulmifolius, and U. jussiaei showed a higher growth across time both in height and in diameter, in the absence of herbivory. This work shows that deer exclusion needs to be considered when aiming at the postfire restoration of Mediterranean shrub communities.},

abstract = {The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

@article{Weisberg2003,
abstract = {Due primarily to anthropogenic influences such as land use change, exotic species introductions, livestock grazing, altered hunting regimes, and predator control, wild ungulate populations have undergone tremendous shifts in recent decades. Although the result has been endangerment or extirpation in some regions, ungulate numbers have increased to locally or regionally high levels in other areas, causing shifts in plant species composition, problems for forest regeneration, and conflict with humans and domestic livestock. Our ability to find solutions to these problems is limited because we lack sufficient understanding of how ungulate species interact with predators, habitat, forage, competing species, and humans at multiple scales from small foraging patches to large regions. To bring together new findings in this area, encompassing various scales and foci of investigation, an international conference on "Forest Dynamics and Ungulate Herbivory" was held from 3 to 6 October 2001 in Davos, Switzerland. We provide a synthetic overview of the papers contained in this Special Issue, arising from that conference. A companion Special Issue of the Journal for Nature Conservation is devoted to the more management-oriented aspects of forest-ungulate interactions, entitled "Forest-Ungulate Interactions: Monitoring, Modeling and Management." From the papers in this issue, a number of important generalizations emerge to guide our understanding and further research. Our predictive understanding of foraging ecology needs to be generalized and scaled up, if it is to become useful for predicting the consequences of herbivory for broad-scale vegetation dynamics. Further, it is important to move beyond single-factor studies, to embrace the complexity of ungulate-vegetation interactions. The direction and magnitude of ungulate influences can be difficult to gauge because of complex interactions among species, structural units of vegetation or landscapes, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbances. Researchers need to look beyond the simplistic concept of "game damage", and comprehensively address the direct and indirect effects of ungulates on communities, ecosystems and landscapes. This may require a more systems-oriented, and less species-oriented approach. Ungulate-vegetation interactions need to be better understood over multiple scales, and particularly at the coarser scales that are of interest to managers and policy-makers. Finally, a long-term view of ungulate-vegetation interactions, where past, present, and future effects are considered in their appropriate temporal context, is absolutely essential. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Wigley2014,
abstract = {The role of grazers in determining vegetation community compositions and structuring plant communities is well recognised in grassy systems. The role of browsers in affecting savanna woody plant communities is less clear. We used three long-term exclosures in the Kruger National Park to determine the effect of browsers on species compositions and population structures of woody communities. Species assemblages, plant traits relating to browsing and soil nutrients were compared inside and outside of the exclosures. Our results showed that browsers directly impact plant species distributions, densities and population structures by actively selecting for species with traits which make them desirable to browsers. Species with high leaf nitrogen, low total phenolic content and low acid detergent lignin appeared to be favoured by herbivores and therefore tend to be rare outside of the exclosures. This study also suggested that browsers have important indirect effects on savanna functioning, as the reduction of woody cover can result in less litter of lower quality, which in turn can result in lower soil fertility. However, the magnitude of browser effects appeared to depend on inherent soil fertility and climate.Conservation implications: Browsers were shown to have significant impacts on plant communities. They have noticeable effects on local species diversity and population structure, as well as soil nutrients. These impacts are shown to be related to the underlying geology and climate. The effects of browsers on woody communities were shown to be greater in low rainfall, fertile areas compared to high rainfall, infertile soils.},

abstract = {Introduced mammalian herbivores are changing the structure and composition of New Zealand's forest ecosystems and may modify forest succession after natural disturbances. We studied how introduced ungulates (red deer and feral pigs) and rodents (rats and house mice) affected the rate of recovery (i.e. the engineering resilience) of the forest understorey following artificial disturbance. We imposed disturbances by clearing understorey vegetation dominated by Blechnum ferns in forests on relatively fertile alluvium and elevated infertile marine terraces, and recorded recovery of vegetation (seedling establishment, species composition, cover and volume) in herbivore exclosures and controls. Seedlings quickly established on cleared plots: after 2 years, numbers of woody seedlings and ground cover of vascular plants relative to initial values were similar on cleared and uncleared treatments. Volume of plant biomass {\textless}2 m remained low on cleared subplots. Ungulates significantly reduced the re-establishment of woody seedlings ≥ 10 cm tall: only one seedling reached this height outside exclosures, compared with 29 seedlings inside. The number of seedlings {\textless}10 cm tall, expressed relative to numbers present pre-clearing, was not significantly affected by ungulates. The species composition of regenerating vegetation was more similar (Jaccard index) to pre-clearing understorey vegetation inside ungulate exclosures than outside. No consistent effect of rodents (primarily house mice) on seedling establishment or species composition was detected after 2 years, and rodent exclosures did not significantly affect survival of seedlings (Griselinia littoralis and Aristotelia serrata) planted as an index of rodent herbivory pressure. No significant differences in vegetation recovery were apparent between forest types. Rapid seedling recruitment in the absence of understorey vegetation and the presence of herbivores provided evidence that understorey vegetation competes with seedlings for light. Ungulate effects were consistent with other experiments that showed herbivores reduced the rate and altered the trajectory of vegetation regrowth after disturbance.},

@article{Ojeda1996,
abstract = {Diversity relations in Mediterranean heathlands and the understorey of oak woodlands on sandstone-derived substrates were studied at both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. Trends in species composition and cover were analysed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis; the first axis, assumed to reflect a main environmental gradient, was used to analyse the patterns of three aspects of community diversity. Species richness, i.e. number of species along a 100-m transect, shows a humpbacked trend along the gradient, with the highest values in the understorey of evergreen Quercus suber woodlands, associated with soils of intermediate fertility and moisture status. The number of endemic species is highest in open heathlands, associated with more extreme conditions of acid, infertile soils on exposed ridges. The taxonomic singularity, as measured by the inverse of the average number of species per genus at each site, is highest at the most fertile and moist sites occupied by semideciduous Q. canariensis woodlands. A comparison between northern (Spanish) and southern (Moroccan) sides of the Strait of Gibraltar shows a general concordance of the trends of woody plant communities along the main environmental gradient. However, significant differences of the southern samples are: (1) lack of some differential, habitat-specific species and greater abundance of widespread generalists; and (2) a general reduction in species diversity, number of endemics and taxonomic singularity. We interpret these differences as affected partly by the smaller extent and fragmentation of sandstone areas in the south, and partly by the higher impact of slashing and grazing there.},
